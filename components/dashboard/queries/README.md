# Dashboard Queries

Encapsulates read-only operations (layout inspection, widget lookups,
preference snapshots) so transports/test suites can reuse common query
code without depending on the full service.

The directory currently contains stubs; populate with concrete queries
during Phase 2 once data contracts are finalized.
