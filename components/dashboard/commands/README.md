# Dashboard Commands

Holds all `go-command.Commander` implementations for dashboard mutations:

- Seeding widget areas/definitions/layouts.
- Assigning/removing/reordering widgets.
- Refresh hooks that notify transports of updates.

Phase 1+2 tasks will flesh out actual commands; for now this README marks
the directory purpose so future contributors understand the layout.
